I am a web designer, developer and film aficionado. Not necessarily in that order. I love building things on the web and designing for the best possible experience across all devices and contexts. 

I found my calling in web design a couple of years ago and I've been learning nonstop ever since. Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Camounster "Twitter"), connect with me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/josecarloscamou "LinkedIn") or send me an [email](mailto:jccamou@gmail.com "email me").
