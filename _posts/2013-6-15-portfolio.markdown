This new redesign marks the 5th iteration of my website. This post is a look back at what my starting point looked like and what I’ve learned from each change.    

## One
This was my first attempt at creating a website. Largely influenced by an agency website (can’t find the link) that displayed their work through the horizontal scroll, I set out to make something that seemed different.

I remember getting the layout “right” was a major accomplishment. The color palette was horrible and the pictures of my work were taken from an old android phone. 

What this did for me was show me that I could make something, even if it wasn’t perfect. 

## Two
Minimalistic design has always fascinated me and having just discovered the concept of “Responsive Web Design” I wanted to try and make something that would implement both. The result was a not-so-subtle integration of both of those concepts.

![portfolio 2b]({{site.site_url}}/img/posts/portfolio-journey/portfolio-2b.png "portfolio 2b")

<img class="no-border" src="{{site.site_url}}/img/posts/portfolio-journey/portfolio-2c.png">

What is important to note about this version is that I successfully created a responsive website for the first time even if it was one of the easiest RWD patterns to implement. 

## Three
The third iteration was a little more traditional in that it had a vertical scroll and that it had a navigation bar in the header. I was able to add a little javascript to fade in and out people’s recommendations of me. 

![portfolio 3]({{site.site_url}}/img/posts/portfolio-journey/portfolio-3.png "portfolio 3")

![portfolio 3b]({{site.site_url}}/img/posts/portfolio-journey/portfolio-3b.png "portfolio 3b")

This was the first time I used the psuedo element `nth-child()` to change the colors of the even numbered items in the list of projects. 

## Four
I went with a bigger font size to provide what I felt was an easier reading experience. I kept the amount of fonts to 1 and the work archive page was very much inspired by The Great Discontent’s [archive page](http://thegreatdiscontent.com/archive). The massive font size and subtle color change from one item to the next really made an impact.  

![portfolio 4]({{site.site_url}}/img/posts/portfolio-journey/portfolio-4.png "portfolio 4")

![portfolio 4b]({{site.site_url}}/img/posts/portfolio-journey/portfolio-4b.png "portfolio 4b")

![portfolio 4c]({{site.site_url}}/img/posts/portfolio-journey/portfolio-4c.png "portfolio 4c")

I kept the same colors as version three but went with a different font. I made sure to make it responsive. 

## Five
This is my fifth iteration. It might not seem like much but compared to the first one this is a massive leap forward and I’m proud of the fact that it only took a year. This iteration is version controlled on [Github](https://github.com/jcamou/josecamou) and built on [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) to avoid having a database (which was more for fun than for actual security). 

The colors were inspired by a Japanese water color art piece and the fonts used are the two fonts I can’t seem to get away from: Omnes Pro and Merriweather.  

All this to say I am proud of what I made and I’m sure I’ll continue to add to it as I keep learning.
