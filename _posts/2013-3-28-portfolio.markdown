ThinkSpace needed a place that could both educate new users while still engaging current users. Educating new users about what ThinkSpace is has proven to be a challenge in itself. 

![thinkspace about]({{site.site_url}}/img/projects/thinkspace-org/about.png "ThinkSpace About")

I designed [thinkspace.org](http://thinkspace-landing.herokuapp.com/ "ThinkSpace.org"), inspired by the mailchimp annual report, which introduces ThinkSpace in a sequence of steps much like a story. Each step fades to a different color to keep the user engaged. To satisfy the current user's needs I created a discussion section that allows them to continue discussions that were taking place off line to form a ThinkSpace community.
