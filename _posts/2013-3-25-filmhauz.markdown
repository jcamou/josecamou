description: "A collection of critical essays and illustrations about film"

There is an abundance of film blogs on the internet but very little take advantage of the web as an artistic medium itself. A well written essay is covered with movie ads, poorly designed site structure and no consideration for smaller screen sizes.

![filmhauz about]({{site.site_url}}/img/projects/filmhauz/filmhauz-about.png "filmhauz about")

I started Filmhauz to fill that void. Built on wordpress and made with every screen in mind.

Each article features art inspired by the film in review and a lenghty discussion written by either my collegue, Rio Ibarra, or myself.
