description: "A collection of critical essays and illustrations about film"
---

There is an abundance of film blogs on the internet but very little take advantage of the web as an artistic medium itself. A well written essay is covered with movie ads, poorly designed site structure and no consideration for smaller screen sizes.

I started Filmhauz to fill that void. Built on wordpress and made with every screen in mind.
