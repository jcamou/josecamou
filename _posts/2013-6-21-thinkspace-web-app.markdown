description: "A critical thinking platform built with pedagogy as its core"
---

ThinkSpace was built with the help of faculty from [Iowa State University](http://www.iastate.edu/). The goal was to create a platform that would allow faculty to distribute case-based assignments to promote critical thinking among students.

I worked on the design and UX and the development was done by the guys over at [Sixth Edge](http://www.sixthedge.com/).

The Observation tool helps students keep track of important information by saving items the user highlights. The user can add comments to each observation to give it more meaning.

Observations can be used to create outline style objects for things such as differentials in a Veterinary class.

Markup is a way to get feedback and have conversations with the professor and/or peers. Faculty can pick from a library of comments to expedite feedback in large classes or create custom comments.
