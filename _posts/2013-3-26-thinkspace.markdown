description: "Marketing site for ThinkSpace to bring new users and engage current users"

ThinkSpace needed a place that could both educate new users while still engaging current users. 

[thinkspace.org](http://www.thinkspace.org/)

I designed [thinkspace.org](http://thinkspace-landing.herokuapp.com/ "ThinkSpace.org"), inspired by the mailchimp annual report, to introduce ThinkSpace in a sequence of steps much like a story. Each step fades to a different color to keep the user engaged with new illustrations and information.

![thinkspace features]({{site.site_url}}/img/projects/thinkspace-org/features.png "ThinkSpace features")

The font used in the headings is x. The rounded corners of the font give the site a friendlier look.

![thinkspace try-it]({{site.site_url}}/img/projects/thinkspace-org/try-it.png "ThinkSpace try-it")

To satisfy the current user's needs I created a discussion section that allows them to continue discussions that were taking place off line to form a ThinkSpace community. I am currently working on redesigning the ThinkSpace interface and match this style.
