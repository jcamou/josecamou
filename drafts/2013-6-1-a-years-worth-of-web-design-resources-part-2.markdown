2012 was the year I decided to focus on a career in web design. In just 1 year I was able to go from knowing nothing about the field to developing a complex web app with current standards and technologies. This is a roadmap of resources that helped me get to where I am now. 

## Notice

This list is organized in a recommended order and is split into 3 chuncks:

1. Getting your feet wet (Month 1 - 3)
2. Dunking the crotch (Month 4 - 8)
3. Full head submersion (Month 9 - 12 and on)

Using a swimming metaphor seems appropriate for this content. 

Each chunk represents the chunk in the year where I found a resource the most helpful without getting too overwhelmed (which is something that happens often in a field where new technologies pop up daily). The items within the chunk are in a recommended order but feel free to jump around. You might find that it takes you longer than a year to feel as comfortable or maybe shorter, but do not get discouraged. Everyone has a different pace.
