         	<p>This new redesign marks the 5th iteration of my website. This post is a look back at what my starting point looked like and what I’ve learned from each change.</p>

<h2>One</h2>

<p>This was my first attempt at creating a website. Largely influenced by an agency website (can’t find the link) that displayed their work through the horizontal scroll, I set out to make something that seemed different.</p>

<p><img src="http://josecamou.com/img/posts/portfolio-journey/portfolio-1.png" title="portfolio 1" alt="portfolio 1" /></p>

<p>I remember getting the layout “right” was a major accomplishment. The color palette was horrible and the pictures of my work were taken from an old android phone.</p>

<p>What this did for me was show me that I could make something, even if it wasn’t perfect.</p>

<h2>Two</h2>

<p>Minimalistic design has always fascinated me and having just discovered the concept of “Responsive Web Design” I wanted to try and make something that would implement both. The result was a not-so-subtle integration of both of those concepts.</p>

<p><img src="http://josecamou.com/img/posts/portfolio-journey/portfolio-2.png" title="portfolio 2" alt="portfolio 2" /></p>

<p><img src="http://josecamou.com/img/posts/portfolio-journey/portfolio-2b.png" title="portfolio 2b" alt="portfolio 2b" /></p>

<p><img class="no-border" src="http://josecamou.com/img/posts/portfolio-journey/portfolio-2c.png"></p>

<p>What is important to note about this version is that I successfully created a responsive website for the first time even if it was one of the easiest RWD patterns to implement.</p>

<h2>Three</h2>

<p>The third iteration was a little more traditional in that it had a vertical scroll and that it had a navigation bar in the header. I was able to add a little javascript to fade in and out people’s recommendations of me.</p>

<p><img src="http://josecamou.com/img/posts/portfolio-journey/portfolio-3.png" title="portfolio 3" alt="portfolio 3" /></p>

<p><img src="http://josecamou.com/img/posts/portfolio-journey/portfolio-3b.png" title="portfolio 3b" alt="portfolio 3b" /></p>

<p>This was the first time I used the psuedo element <code>nth-child()</code> to change the colors of the even numbered items in the list of projects.</p>

<h2>Four</h2>

<p>I went with a bigger font size to provide what I felt was an easier reading experience. I kept the amount of fonts to 1 and the work archive page was very much inspired by The Great Discontent’s <a href="http://thegreatdiscontent.com/archive">archive page</a>. The massive font size and subtle color change from one item to the next really made an impact.</p>

<p><img src="http://josecamou.com/img/posts/portfolio-journey/portfolio-4.png" title="portfolio 4" alt="portfolio 4" /></p>

<p><img src="http://josecamou.com/img/posts/portfolio-journey/portfolio-4b.png" title="portfolio 4b" alt="portfolio 4b" /></p>

<p><img src="http://josecamou.com/img/posts/portfolio-journey/portfolio-4c.png" title="portfolio 4c" alt="portfolio 4c" /></p>

<p>I kept the same colors as version three but went with a different font. I made sure to make it responsive.</p>

<h2>Five</h2>

<p>This is my fifth iteration. It might not seem like much but compared to the first one this is a massive leap forward and I’m proud of the fact that it only took a year. This iteration is version controlled on <a href="https://github.com/jcamou/josecamou">Github</a> and built on <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> to avoid having a database (which was more for fun than for actual security).</p>

<p>The colors were inspired by a Japanese water color art piece and the fonts used are the two fonts I can’t seem to get away from: Omnes Pro and Merriweather.</p>

<p>All this to say I am proud of what I made and I’m sure I’ll continue to add to it as I keep learning.</p>
