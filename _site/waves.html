    					Twitter - First things first, get a twitter account if you haven't gotten one yet. Twitter puts you in the center of conversations between the big pro's who love tweeting out the most recent resources and relevant comments and articles. Even if at first you don't understand any of it, the more you see things and see what they're doing the more familiar things will seem. So when you hear someone talk about "Flexbox" you can know what they're talking about or even better you can give them a good resource you found through twitter about it. 

                        HTML5 for Web Designers by Jeremy Keith - This is a great read by the extremely entertaining Jeremy Keith. The book is only about 80 pages but it manages to give you a quick history of how we got to html5 (which is great when you're starting because you hear everyone, especially non web developers, throw around the term HTML5) and the advantages and disadvantages of using html5. This isn't what I would call a technical book with pages and pages of code but more of a book about HTML5 with some sample code for illustrating the point which help the newbies recognize what good semantic code looks like. 

                        Smashing Mag - <a href="#">When I found smashingmag.com </a>I felt like a kid in a candy store. There are articles uploaded constantly and sorted by Design, Coding, etc. 
                        Smashingmag.com is great for beginners because it offers an abundance of beginner level articles with pretty in depth explanations. I wouldn't base everything on these articles of course but its a great place to get a perspective on several important subjects. There are plenty of tutorials as well.
